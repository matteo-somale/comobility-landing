### What Is Mobility Poverty?

In contemporary societies, often described as _hyper-mobile_, freedom of movement is widely considered a fundamental right. Yet, for many people, participation in social, political, and economic life is limited by insufficient access to mobility options. This condition is known as **mobility poverty**.

Mobility poverty occurs when individuals are unable to access resources, services, and social networks due—entirely or partially—to an inadequate mobility offer. This phenomenon persists despite technological progress and the widespread availability of transport systems.

### From “Mobility for All” to Mobility Poverty

Historically, the idea of _mobility for all_—mobility not dependent on car ownership—is relatively recent. Only in recent decades has access to movement been framed as a collective right rather than a private privilege.

Although mobility poverty has gained academic and political attention, it still lacks full recognition. Policymakers, researchers, and practitioners continue to call for deeper understanding and awareness of its implications.

### Mobility Poverty vs. Transport Poverty

Mobility poverty is often confused with **transport poverty**, but the two are not the same.

- **Transport poverty** refers to concrete issues such as lack of transport services, poor affordability, limited physical accessibility, and inadequate infrastructure.
- **Mobility poverty**, instead, is a broader concept. It includes transport poverty but also encompasses social, cultural, and personal factors that limit people’s _capability_ or _perceived possibility_ to move.

In other words, mobility poverty is not only about the absence of transport, but about reduced opportunities for movement overall.

### A Multidimensional Form of Inequality

Mobility poverty reflects existing social inequalities related to class, gender, age, social status, physical ability, and territory. Not everyone has the same capacity to decide _if_, _when_, _where_, and _how_ to move. Today, the ability to choose mobility options has itself become a privilege.

Importantly, mobility poverty is not solely linked to low income. While economic constraints—such as the cost of owning a car or purchasing a transit pass—play a role, mobility poverty is also shaped by sociocultural, relational, and contextual conditions.

### Perception, Adaptation, and Exclusion

Mobility poverty is closely tied to perception. Individuals—especially vulnerable groups—may adjust their needs, expectations, and life choices based on what they believe is _within their reach_. This self-limitation often leads to reduced access to education, employment, healthcare, and social participation.

As a result, mobility poverty frequently produces **social exclusion**, reinforcing cycles of marginalization and inequality.

### Rural Mobility Poverty

Mobility poverty is particularly acute in **rural areas**. As populations migrate toward cities in search of opportunities and services, rural regions experience depopulation and aging. This decline in demand often leads to reduced public transport services.

Fewer passengers increase operational costs, encouraging private car use. Those who cannot afford a car face severe limitations in their freedom of movement, with direct consequences for work, education, healthcare, and social life.

### The Need for Coordinated Policy Action

At the European level, rural mobility remains insufficiently addressed. There is a lack of dedicated policies and clear national responsibility for rural transport services.

To tackle rural mobility poverty, it is essential to rethink collective transport systems, promote shared mobility solutions, and implement coordinated strategies across local, regional, and national levels. Only through integrated and inclusive mobility planning can equal access to movement become a reality.
